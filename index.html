  	 	<h1>Hello, I'm Arthur!</h1>
  	     <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" class="img-circle"></p>

  		 Welcome to my page! My name is Arthur Pasquier, and I’m 18 years old. Currently, I’m studying at IESEG School of Management in Paris. Through this page, you’ll get to know my personality and passions. From my love for the piano and golf to my fascination with luxury hotels, Michelin-starred restaurants, and stunning cars, I have a wide range of interests that I’m excited to share with you.

		 By clicking below on Lartisien, you’ll discover a website that has always inspired me. Lartisien showcases a curated selection of unique and luxurious hotels around the world, offering you the chance to explore some truly special places that you might not often see. This website is a source of inspiration for me since it highlights the beauty and elegance of exceptional hospitality, fueling my dream to one day create my own luxurious restaurant and hotel experiences.

  	  	<h2>Hotel/Restaurant industry</h2>
    	<p>
     	  I have a deep passion for luxurious places, such as 5-star hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants. Growing up, my parents often took me to these exquisite venues to share great experiences and help me develop my tastes. My dream is to open my own restaurant, offering exceptional food and a wonderful ambiance. From there, I aspire to expand and become a leader in the hospitality industry.

    	<h2>Golf</h2>
    	<p>
      	 I’ve been playing golf for 8 years, and it’s a sport that makes me feel free and connected with nature, which is incredibly comforting in today’s world. One of my most memorable experiences was a two-week training stage in Scotland at St Andrews, the “Home of Golf.” Walking the historic fairways where the game was born was truly inspiring.

		 I also admire great players like Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, and Jon Rahm. Tiger Woods, with his 15 major championships and 82 PGA Tour wins, has set numerous records. Rory McIlroy, known for his powerful drives, has won four major championships and is a three-time FedEx Cup champion. Jon Rahm, with his recent Masters and U.S. Open victories, continues to impress with his consistency and skill.

		 Among these greats, my favorite is Tiger Woods. His life and career are incredibly interesting. If you want to learn more about him, you can click on his picture to read his biography!

    	<h2>Music</h2>
    	<p>
      	 My passion for music began with the piano, which I started playing at the age of five. This early start opened me up to various musical genres and led to many concert experiences that deepened my love for music.

		 Lately, I’ve been really into house music. I love its diverse melodies and the energy it brings. House music, with its repetitive beats and uplifting rhythms, creates an atmosphere that’s both exciting and unifying. Attending house music events has been amazing, as the sense of community and shared passion make for an unforgettable experience. The genre’s ability to bring people together and its endless variety keep me hooked.

     <h2>Automobiles</h2>
     <p>
       My passion for great engineering and beautiful curves ignited when I was just 10 years old. I often found myself wandering through car dealerships, mesmerized by the latest models and the intricate details of their engines. This fascination led me to create an Instagram account dedicated to cars, where I share pictures of stunning vehicles I encounter on the streets. I would love to open my own car dealership one day, all while pursuing a career in the hotel and restaurant industry. You can find just bellow, by clicking on "MyInstagram", my car account on Instagram. Hope you will like it!
